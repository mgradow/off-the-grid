            <p>Chris McCandless was your average 24 year old man. I'm sure we've all had the thought of running away when we were younger, but we never would. Chris is the exception. Chris wanted to see the wilderness and get away from his parents. Supposedly being a 2 year adventure in the wilderness, Chris ventured the Alaskan wilderness and survived off of berries and scraps he found. </p>

            <p>Now he may not have had the appropriate stuff to properly live, but that's what is gonna make you different! Now out your skills and knowledge to use and try not to fall behind too far.</p>
